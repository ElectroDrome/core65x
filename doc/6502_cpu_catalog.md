# 🧠 6502-Compatible CPU Reference Catalog

A meticulously curated and richly annotated database of over 120 CPUs and SoCs based on the **MOS Technology 6502 architecture**, spanning nearly five decades of computing history.  
This project collects and compares processors from pioneers like **MOS**, **WDC**, and **Rockwell**, as well as lesser-known or embedded clones from **Sunplus**, **Ricoh**, **UMC**, **Mitsubishi**, and more — including systems used in **Commodore, Nintendo, Atari**, and various embedded devices.

## 📘 What’s Inside

- **125+ CPU entries** across **25+ manufacturers**
- Unified view of:
  - Architecture and variant type (NMOS, CMOS, 8-/16-bit, SoC, MCU)
  - **Release year**, opcode range, and signal support (`IRQ`, `NMI`, `RDY`, `SYNC`, `φ2`, etc.)
  - Clock speeds (rated/typical MHz)
  - **I/O characteristics** (bit-width or feature sets)
  - Address space layout (standard 64 KiB or banked/extended)
  - Notable features and usage (e.g. used in NES, C64, SNES, speech chips, display controllers)

## 🎯 Use Cases

- As a **developer**: Check compatibility of 6502 variants for hardware/emulator targets
- As an **educator**: Use as reference material in retro computing or embedded systems curricula
- As a **historian/archivist**: Explore the diffusion and evolution of 8-bit CPU design
- As a **hobbyist**: Compare SoCs used in old consoles, DIY kits, or microcontrollers
